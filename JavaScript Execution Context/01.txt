JavaScript Execution Context

 JScode --> Global Execution Context (EC)
 stored global EC into variable-this
 ->Functional Executional Context
 ->Eval execution Context only occurs in case of mongoDB, DataBase , this is specially an object of Global EC


 JsCode runs in two phases -->
                (1) Memory creation phases, whatsoever variables declared, spaces are allocated to them in memory
                (2) Execution Phase

                let valt1 = 10;
                let valt2 = 5;
                function addNumber(num1, num2){
                    let total = num1 + num2;
                    return total;
                }
                let result1 = addNumber(valt1, valt2);
                let result2 = addNumber(10, 2);


(1) Global Execution Context(Global Execution Environment) -> allocated into this-variable
(2)Memory creation Phase ->spaces are allocated To whatsoever variables are declared, in memory.
    valt1 -> undefined
    valt2 -> undefined
    addNumber -> function definition
    result1 -> undefined
    result2 -> undefined
(3) Execution Phase ->
    valt1 <-- 10
    valt2 <-- 5
    addNumber will wait for Data
    result1 -> as result1 would store addNumber that's why addNumber will create another seperate execution context->

                                                                                valt2 --. undefined
                                                                                total --> undefined
                                                                                (2)Execution Phase
                                                                                num1 <--10
                                                                                num2 <--5
                                                                                tottal <-- 15 -this value will return to Global Execution Context,
                                                                                this context will be deleted after done its responsibility
    now result1 <--15
    result2 -->similar operations as in the case of result1, then  result2 <-- 15
